# Markdown App
Author - Hammad Swati


This Markdown App is a simple web application built using React. It provides a convenient interface for users to input Markdown syntax in one half of the screen and instantly view the rendered output in the other half. The application leverages the "react-markdown" library to dynamically convert the user-input Markdown into HTML, offering a real-time preview.

Key features of the Markdown App include a clean and user-friendly interface with distinct Input and Output sections. Users can input their Markdown content in a textarea on one side, and the corresponding HTML-rendered output is displayed in a well-designed and responsive manner on the opposite side.

The app is structured with React state management using the "useState" hook to capture and update the user's Markdown input. The layout is designed for clarity, with a bold heading, distinct input and output sections, and a responsive design that makes it visually appealing.

Overall, this Markdown App serves as a handy tool for users who want to write and preview Markdown content efficiently. It can be easily integrated into various projects or used as a standalone application to streamline the Markdown editing and previewing process.
